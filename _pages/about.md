Hi, I am Jiakang. I have a background in theoretical physics and machine learning, and I’m currently exploring new computing paradigms at the intersection of physics and AI.

My MSci project on supergravity revealed to me the deep beauty of physics and the universe. Later, during my MSc in Machine Learning, I developed a neural network–based solver for partial differential equations (PDEs), which deepened my interest in physics-informed AI methods. These experiences showed me how powerful AI can be as a tool for advancing physics research — and how, in turn, physics can inspire new approaches in AI.

My research interests include physics-informed machine learning, AI for physics research, and physics-inspired computing.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!
