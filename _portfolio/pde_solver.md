This project, developed during my MSc in Machine Learning, implements a neural networkâ€“based solver for partial differential equations (PDEs). It explores the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), DeepRitz method (DRM) and weak adversarial networks (WAN) to approximate solutions efficiently.
